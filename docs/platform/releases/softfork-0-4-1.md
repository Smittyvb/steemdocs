- No new method or operation were introduced in this softfork.
- No new method or operation were disabled or deprecated in this softfork.

## Bug Fix

This update allows to restart [steemd](/glossary/steemd.md) without replaying the blockchain.

## Context of HF4

This was in the very early days Steem were there were only a few people who could access a user interface of the network. The Steemit Inc team, who was mainly in charge of developing the software, iterated quickly through a series of hardforks and softforks to make it functional as a decentralized content management system
