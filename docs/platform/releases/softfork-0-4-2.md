It was an optional upgrade for users of [0.4.0](/releases/harfork-0-4-0.md).

## New Features

2- Encrypted blockchain based private messages are now supported
3- Updates were made on how payouts are projected / calculated
4- [cli wallet](/glossary/cli-wallet.md) has been added to get private keys from password used on steemit.com

## Context of HF4

This was in the very early days Steem were there were only a few people who could access a user interface of the network. The Steemit Inc team, who was mainly in charge of developing the software, iterated quickly through a series of hardforks and softforks to make it functional as a decentralized content management system. This is the first release that introduced new features for users and developers.
