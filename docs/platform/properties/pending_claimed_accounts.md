# `pending_claimed_accounts`

An accountâ€™s `pending_claimed_accounts` balance reflects the number of discounted accounts that have been successfully claimed using the [`claim_account`](/platform/operations/claim_account.md) operation. Pending claimed accounts are not transferable to other users, but they do not expire, and there is no limit on how many an account can hold.
