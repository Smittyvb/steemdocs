# Owner's Key

The **owner key** is the most important key of a user [account](/glossary/account.md). When a user enter his/her **owner's key** into an application, it unlocks all the capabilities of their [posting key](/glossary/posting-key.md), [active key](/glossary/active-key.md), [memo key](/glossary/memo-key.md) as well as the ability to change all the keys by changing the **owner's key** itself. It is for this reason that it is suggested to never use the **owner's key** to log into a [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) application.

Your **owner key** can be changed either through the CLI Wallet or through the SteemIt interface at www.steemit.com/@your_username/permissions
