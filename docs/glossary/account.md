# Account

On the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md), each user needs at least one **account** that can be used to interact with the [blockchain](/glossary/blockchain.md). Each account has an address that is human readable (aka @username). Once an **account** is registered on the blockchain, all [transactions](/glossary/transaction.md) ([upvotes](/glossary/voting.md), [posts](/glossary/posting.md), comments, [transfers](/glossary/transfer.md)) can be audited through a block explorer such as [steemd](/glossary/steemd.md).

Each **account** has 4 sets of [public](/glossary/public-key.md) and [private](/glossary/private-key.md) keys:

- [Posting Keys](/glossary/posting-key.md) - for [posting](/glossary/posting.md) and [upvoting](/glossary/voting.md) content
- [Active Keys](/glossary/active-key.md) - for [tranfers of funds](/glossary/transfer.md)  
- [Owner Keys](/glossary/owner-key.md) - for full access and changing all private/public keys 
- [Memo Keys](/glossary/memo-key.md) - for encrypted [memos](/glossary/memo.md)
