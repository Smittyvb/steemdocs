# Resteem

"Resteeming" is the term used on the [Steem blockchain](/glossary/steem-blockchain.md) to share the content of an [author](/glossary/author.md) to one's [followers](/glossary/follow.md). When a user **resteem** an author's article, it helps increase the visibility of the post. It is, like many operations on the blockchain, a [Custom JSON](/glossary/custom-json.md) operation. Developers can use the brand-specific term they want for this operation on their application to represent the same idea.
